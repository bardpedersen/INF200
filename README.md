# BioSim A17 Peder BÃ¥rd

# Description
January project for INF200 January 2022. This program is simulating the ecosystem on an island with one species of carnivores and one spice of herbivores. The island has three types of land dessert, low land and high land. The island is surrounded by water so no animals can migrate. To read the full task look in INF200_H21_BioSimJan_v1.pdf.
